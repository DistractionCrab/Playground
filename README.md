# Game Engine Playground
This project is intended as both a large demonstration of implementations in Unreal 5 and Unity as well as a portfolio project showcasing what I am capable of in some game engines. On the emphatic note, this isn't a demonstration of my artistic abilities; While I will do some 3D modeling and some art work here and there, this is a portfolio for coding, programming, organization, and engineering. 


# FAQ

- Why is this project so small? 

- I started this recently to have a more demonstrable project for my knowledge. While I've worked with these for quite some time, they have been either under contract for NDA, they're smaller projects spread out (Like Charm-Crab), or I just built a game from scratch rather than use an engine.

- I'd like you to implement an idea or help me with an idea!

- Make an issue with \[Request\] in the title and I'll see what I can do. I'm always looking for more things to make to add to this, because it's fun.
