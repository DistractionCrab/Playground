# Game Engine Playground
This is a work-in-progress project intended to be a portfolio of what I can do with Unreal Engine and Unity. This is a cross-disciplinary projects with me developing not only the code for a game, but as well as assets, engineering, design, feature implementation and art. This project has been in development for approximately three weeks at this point.

# Completed:
- Base Character State Machine design
- Dynamical realistic water materials.
- Dynamic perspective API
- Interactive objects system and API
- Chasing AI
- Simple general Spellcasting System
- Faction System

# Started
- Village/Town design
- Character attack animation system.
- Develop dynamical grass system based off of Ghost of Tsushima's bezier approach.
- - Does animate, need to work on parameterizations for individual blades.

# Tasks
- Develop custom gravitational orientations for walking on walls.
- Make the chasing AI attack in various ways.
- Object Pooling system for projectiles
- Update BTT to better manage patrol point index: Current increments the index regardless of success. Not a big problem, but does cause some oddities when noticing the player
