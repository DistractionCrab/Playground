# Game Engine Playground
This project is intended as both a large demonstration of implementations in Unreal 5 and Unity as well as a portfolio project showcasing what I am capable of in some game engines. 

# Completed:
- Base Character State Machine design
- Dynamical realistic water materials.
- Dynamic perspective API
- Interactive objects system and API
- Chasing AI

# Started
- Village/Town design
- RPG Mechanics
- - Factions
- - Spell effects and system
- Character attack animation system.

# Tasks

- Develop dynamical grass system based off of Ghost of Tsushima's bezier approach.
- Develop custom gravitational orientations for walking on walls.
- Make the chasing AI attack in various ways.
- Object Pooling system for projectiles
- Update patrolling to ignore neutral characters.


# Updates to do:
- Update BTT to better manage patrol point index: Current increments the index regardless of success. Not a big problem, but does cause some oddities when noticing the player
