# UE Generated Assets

This directory contains the assets generated by the modeling tools in UE5. This is intended to store the FBX exports from those generated files for modification through blender. To properly utilize this setup for UE5's modeling tools, for each mesh you generate and intend to modify export it to an FBX file in this directory (and give it a not-dumb name). In UE5, in the generated mesh's information, search for import and add that FBX file as a source file under File Path. This ensures you can easily reimport the mesh each time you wish to modify it.
